## Deep Learning & AI

### NN (Neural Network)

- **hidden layer** makes NN have a great power to learn
- if many number of hidden layers are used, then it's DNN, or it's CNN

### Deep Learning

- Deep learning seeks to learn rich hierarchical representations (i.e features) automatically through multiple stage of feature learning process

### Convolutional Neural Network

- CNN are a special type of NN whose **hidden units are only connected to local receptive field**. The number of parameters needed by CNN is much smaller.

### **Three Stages of a Convolutional Layer**

1. Convolution stage
2. Nonlinearity: a nonlinear transform such as rectified linear or tanh (双曲正切)
3. Pooling: output a summary statistics of local input, such as max pooling and average pooling

### Pooling

#### Common pooling operations:

- Max pooling: reports the maximum output within a rectangular neighborhood.
- Average pooling: reports the average output of a rectangular neighborhood (possibly weighed by the distance from the central pixel)

### CNN/DNN Examples:

- Image Classification

### Question:  How to avoid the dark side of AI？

## Accounting and AI

### The Basic Accounting Equation

Assets = Liabilities + Owners' Equity

- The balance sheet is an expanded expression of the accounting equation

#### Revenues

- Revenues are inflows of assets (or reductions in liabilities) in exchange for providing goods and services to customers.

#### Expenses

- Expenses occur when resources are consumed in order to generate revenue.
- Examples include rent, salaries and wages, insurance, electricity, utilities, and the like.

### The Profit and Loss Account

The profit and loss statement shows the trading performance of the business and the distribution of profit. Profit is not equivalent to cash in bank

### Hype Cycle Model (HCM)

Technologies Go Through a Life Cycle

### Definition of AI

- AI is a broad term that refers to technologies that make machines "smart." Organization are investing in AI research and applications to automate, augment, or replicate human intelligence-human analytical and/or decision-making 

### AI - The Basics: Big Data & Algorithms

#### Big Data

- Big data means more than just large amounts of data - **big data refers to data (information) that reaches such high volume, variety, velocity and variability** that organizations invest in system architectures, tools, and practices specifically designed to handle the data.
- Volume: scale of data
- Velocity: analysis of streaming data
- Variety: different forms of data
- Veracity: uncertainty of data

#### Algorithms

- An algorithm is s set of rules for the machine to follow. **An algorithm is what enables a machine to quickly process vast amounts of data that a human cannot reasonably process, or even comprehend.** The performance and accuracy of algorithms is very important.
- "effective calculability" or "effective method"
- **A sequence of instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or perform a computation**
- Algorithms are unambiguous specifications for performing calculation, data processing, automated reasoning, and other tasks.

#### AI - The Basics: Types of AI

1. Reactive Machines
   It perceives its environment/situation directly and acts on what it sees. It doesn't have a concept of the wide world. It can't form memories or draw on past experiences to affect current decisions. It specializes only in one area
   - Deep Blue
   - AlphaGo
2. Limited Memory
   Further up on the AI evolutionary ladder: this type considers pieces of past information and adds them to its preprogrammed representations of the world. It has just enough memory or experience to make proper decisions and execute appropriate actions.
   - Self-driving vehicles
   - Chatbots, personal digital assistants
3. Theory of mind
   Type III AI has the capacity to understand thoughts and emotions which affect human behavior. This type-which can comprehend feelings, motives, intentions, and expectations, and can interact socially-has yet to be built, but would likely be the next class of intelligent machines
   - C-3P0 and R2-D2 from the Star Wars universe
   - Sonny in the 2004 film I, Robot
4. Self Awareness
   These types of AI can form representations about themselves. An extension of the theory of mind, they are aware of their internal states, can predict the feelings of others, and can make abstractions and inferences. They are the future generation of machines: super intelligent, sentient, and conscious
   -  Eva in the 2015 movie Ex Machina
   -  Synths in the 2015 TV series Humans

### Roles of AI in Accounting

- No More: book keepers, data entry operators, compliance inspectors
- Accounting departments overall will be trimmed down and the employees left will be able to **focus on more strategic and value adding initiatives, like process improvement, cost control, and capital optimisation.**

#### What skills must CPAs develop or strengthen to be relevant and employable in 2030?

1. Business advisors and strategists
   - AI will do the number crunching and analysis. The accountant must be able to use these to **help drive long term business strategy and value creation.**
2. Specialism in complex accounting niches that are fluid and changing like tax law
3. Accounting Technicians must upgrade to CPA level as soon as possible because those tasks will soon be fully automated

## Business Model & AI - Platform Business

### What is Platform?

- Is a nexus of **rules** and **architecture**

- Is open, allowing regulated **participation**

- Actively promotes (positive) **interactions** among different partners in a multi-sided market

- **Scales** much faster than a pipeline business because it does not necessarily bear the costs of external production

Platform beats products/services

### Platforms leverage network effects

More users = more value = more users...

- Business and technology building blocks
- Resources user in common; **network effects**
- Match buyers & suppliers; transact and create value using platform resources

### Platformmisation

- A platform business model creates value by facilitating interactions between the different customer segments (eg matchmaking and transaction costs reduction)
- Platform business models are often labelled “two-sided markets” or ”multi-sided markets”, on the basis of how many customer segments they work with
- Platforms generate network effects (see below) but also a chicken-and-egg problem in terms of how to attract both sides of the market at the same time (they use “ratcheting” or “zig zag” strategies to achieve this

#### Network Effects

- Direct/same side network effects: the more users in one customer segment will attract more users in that customer segment (users of fax machines; users of an instant messaging system)
- Indirect/cross-side network effects: the more users in one customer segment will attract more users in the other customer segment (users of videogames and game developers)

#### Examples of Platforms

- Apple iPod/iTunes system
- Windows operating system
- Google platform
- Ebay
- Credit cards
- Newspapers

### Platform business

#### Definition and network effects

- A platform business model creates value by facilitating interactions between the different customer segments (eg matchmaking and transaction including search cost reduction)
- Platform business models are often labelled “two-sided markets” or ”multi-sided markets”, on the basis of how many customer segments they work with
- The value of the platform grows to the extent that is attracts more users
  - direct/same side network effects: the more users in one customer segment will attract more users in that customer segment (users of fax machines; users of an instant messaging system
  - Indirect/cross-side network effects: the more users in one customer segment will attract more users in the other customer segment (users o videogames and game developers)

#### Key success factors

- Attract both customers on board at the same time through a **sophisticated price mechanism**
  - You might need to subsidize the more **price sensitive segment** and charge the side that increases its demand more strongly as a result of the other side growth (Xbox, PSP)
  - In markets with high **sensitivity to quality**, you may need to charge more the side that has to supply quality. In this way, you are able to attract providers of high quality products (Xbox, PSP) and maintain a quality platform that attracts the other side of the market

- Acquiring new customers at a low cost
- Retain customers for a long period of time
- Attract "lead" users, with lower joining prices or agreements not to join rival platforms to build initial momentum

### Wii

Wii attracts a large group of casual gamers with relatively inexpensive consoles and royalties from game developers

#### Key points

- Originally, Nintendo's Wii value proposition was attractive on non professional gamers because of the "fun factor" and "social interactions" - especially younger children, retirement home communities and families
- These didn't need a sophisticated and expensive technology like hardcore gamers but wanted a simple intuitive interface model

### Freemium as a business model: 

providing the service for free to some customer segments to subsidize other customer segments

- Skype is an example of platform business model with a freemium component
- A large base of free users is subsidized by a small base of paying users

## Healthcare and AI

### Why AI for Healthcare?

- Definition: use of a computer to model intelligent behavior with minimal human intervention
- Machine & computer programs are capable of **problem solving and learning, like a human brain**
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) and translation
  - Pattern recognition
  - Visual perception and
  - Decision making

- Machine Learning (ML), one of the most exciting areas for Development of computational approaches to **automatically make sense of data**
- Advantage of Machine
  - Can retain information
  - **Becomes smarter over time**
  - Machine is **not susceptible** to Sleep deprivation, distractions, information overload and short-term memory loss

### The application of AI in medicine has two main branches:

1. Virtual branch
   - The virtual component is represented by Machine Learning, (also called Deep Learning)-mathematical algorithms that improve learning through experience.

2. Physical branch
   - Physical objects
   - Medical devices
   - Sophisticated robots for delivery of care (carebots)/ robots for surgery.

### Benefits of AI in Healthcare

- Highly repetitive work
- Empower doctors
- Augment the professionals, offering them expertise and assistance.
- Replace personnel and staffing in medical facilities, particularly in administrative functions,
- Managing wait times & automating scheduling
- AI will not replace clinicians

### Healthcare Data

- AI systems can be deployed in healthcare applications
  - they need to be ‘trained’ through data that are generated from clinical activities
    - (ex) screening, diagnosis, treatment assignment

- clinical data often exist
  - in the form of demographics, medical notes, electronic recordings from medical devices, physical examinations and clinical laboratory and images.

### Two Major Data Sources

#### EP data

- electrophysiological (EP) data
  - they contain large portions of unstructured narrative texts
    - (ex) clinical notes, that are not directly analyzable

- electronic medical record (EMR)
  - An electronic (digital) collection of medical information about a person that is stored on a computer.
  - EMR includes information about a patient’s health history,
    - such as diagnoses, medicines, tests, allergies, immunizations, and treatment plans. 
  - EMR can be seen by all healthcare providers who are taking care of a patient and can be used by them to help make recommendations about the patient’s care.
